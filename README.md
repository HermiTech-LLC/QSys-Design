# QSys Design

## Introduction
QSys Design is a sophisticated application integrating quantum computing with robotics. It provides tools for designing quantum circuits, simulating quantum computations, and managing robotics-related data. This application, named "Qros.py", is built using Python, with key dependencies including Qiskit for quantum computing, pandas for data management, and wxPython for the graphical user interface.

## Features
- **Quantum Circuit Management**: Create and modify quantum circuits using Qiskit.
- **Quantum Computations**: Simulate quantum circuits and extract state vectors.
- **Data Management**: Import, export, and analyze datasets using pandas.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Intuitive and user-friendly interface built with wxPython.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for effective tracking and debugging.

## Installation
To install QSys Design, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/LoQiseaking69/QSys-/tree/main
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the application, navigate to the cloned directory and execute:

```
python Qros.py
```
